        <h4>
            I'm going to start this with a story.
            <br />
            <br />
            Close your eyes and imagine ...
            <br />
            Imagine it's 5 p.m and the whole city is on the streets, and you are sitting
            sweating and dying to get home but suddenly the man / woman next you got a
            heart attack you are trying to save him / her by calling the ambulance but for a
            nearby ambulance to show up we will need up to 5 min.s and that if you are
            living in a ghost town not in the rush hour and during heavy traffic,
            So let's imagine again that you have the proper training to handle injuries and
            heart attacks the situation will be different here where my idea come to play
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <strong>"Fast Rescue"</strong>
            is targeting cases which is hard to be reached by regular ambulances using
            regular civilians in the area.
            <br/>
            This will allow people like lawyers and engineers to also be paramedics, so
            they can save and serve ppl whom can't be saved by regular paramedics.
            <br />
            <br />
            The platform will provide the necessary training for the civil paramedics and
            with the gov. funding we should provide the paramedics with necessary equipments
            more like a first-aid kit for each civil-paramedic.

    <h4>
        The platform is equipped with a tracking system for each case and each paramedic so
        the system is not used for stealing money or kidnapping humans.
    </h4>

    <hr style="border-color: #003333" />
    <h2 style="text-decoration: underline">How it actually works ?!</h2>
    <h4>
        The paramedic get a notification for a case which is 10 kms or less, and he has the choice
        to the answer the call or not but there's a very simple question, How on earth would the
        paramedic will get the notification ?
        <br />
        The answer is easy <strong>watch sensors</strong> every person on the planet have a smart watch
        or band, the band by nature is connected the phone via bluetooth so with any change in the vital
        readings of the person the phone should notify the paramedics within 10 kms of the incidents, And again
        the process itself is actually monitored from the very beginning till the end.

        I've asked the whole idea is actually illegal inside of Czech republic, but it's not illegal in Israel so I am going
        to leave this website alive on my subdomain maybe by a miracle someone will pump into this page and read the idea
        and turn it into reality ,regards ;)

        Oh ! sorry for the ugly design :D
